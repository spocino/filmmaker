# Filmmaker

Filmmaker is a simple non-linear video editor designed for [elementary OS](https://elementary.io).
Filmmaker is intended for ameteur use and is designed to be as user-friendly as possible without requiring knowledge
of digital video editing jargon and UX design patterns. This project intends to fill the same niche as proprietary software
like iMovie and Windows Movie Maker.

Filmmaker is currently pre-alpha software and is entirely unusable for even simple projects.
